***The aim of the task is to determine the relative positioning of the stack and heap segments in the computer's address space. To do this, create four variables allocated on the stack (statically) and on the heap (dynamically). Then observe how the addresses of consecutive variables allocated in each memory segment change. Based on this, determine the relative positioning of the stack and heap (which segment lies higher in the address space) and answer the question: is it theoretically possible for both segments to overlap? (observe in which direction the stack and heap expand).***
