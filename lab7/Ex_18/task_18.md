*** Using the C++ language (g++ compiler) and the std::ofstream and std::ifstream classes, write a program that will read the first 20 characters from all specified text files, then concatenate the read characters into one string and save it in a file named "compilation.txt". The names (or paths) of the files should be passed to the program as arguments to the main() function. ***
