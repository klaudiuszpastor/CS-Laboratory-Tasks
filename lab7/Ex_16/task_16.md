 *** Using the C language (gcc compiler), write a program that will receive ASCII characters from the keyboard until the occurrence of the letter 'q' (or 'Q'), and then save them as a single string in a text file named input.txt. Characters are entered independently, one after another. The user can input a maximum of 20 characters. If the letter 'q' does not occur earlier, the program should save the entered characters to the file and terminate its operation. ***
