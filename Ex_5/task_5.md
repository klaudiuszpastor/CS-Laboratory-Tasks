*** Using any loop, write a function void decimalToBinary(unsigned int number) that takes an integer (in decimal) and displays its binary equivalent on the console. The function declaration is placed in the conversion.h file. Place the function definition in the conversion.c file. Call the implemented function in the main() function and verify its correct operation. Hint: the printf() function does not have a format string to display the binary representation of numbers. To display the converted number correctly using the printf() function, save it to a variable as a decimal number in the following form (example for the binary number 101011) ***
