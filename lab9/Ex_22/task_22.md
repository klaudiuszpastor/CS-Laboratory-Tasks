The file triangle.h contains declarations of the structure Point_t, which stores coordinates of a point on the plane, and the function bool isRightTriangle(Point_t points[]), which checks whether three given points on the plane form a right triangle. Points are passed as an array of Point_t structures. Write the definition of the function isRightTriangle() and place it in the file triangle.c, then test the implemented function. Retrieve the x, y coordinates of the points from the keyboard. For simplicity, you can assume that the function's behavior is undefined if the array of points has a size other than 3.
