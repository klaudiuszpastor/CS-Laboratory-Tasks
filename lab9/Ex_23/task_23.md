The file memory_sector.h contains the declaration of the structure memory_sector_t, simulating a linear memory area. The structure consists of three fields: l_fence and r_fence - intended for initializing the left and right memory barriers, and an array buffer of random size. The type of the structure is declared by calling the macro INITIALIZE_MEMORY_SECTOR() (with each program compilation, a different size of the buffer component is randomly selected). The file memory_operations.h contains declarations of functions:

int *get_left_fence_address(memory_sector_t *) - returning the address of the left memory barrier (l_fence) of an instance of the memory_sector_t structure.
int *get_right_fence_address(memory_sector_t *) - returning the address of the right memory barrier (r_fence) of an instance of the memory_sector_t structure.
size_t get_memory_buffer_size(memory_sector_t *) - returning the size of the buffer (buffer) of an instance of the memory_sector_t structure.
void initialize_memory(memory_sector_t *) - initializing an instance of the memory_sector_t structure, i.e., initializing l_fence and r_fence with the value of FENCE_INITIALIZER and filling the buffer array with the values of BUFFER_INITIALIZER.
address_status_t validate_address(memory_sector_t *memory_sector, const int *address) - checking if the specified address (address) lies within the memory area allocated to the memory_sector. The function returns one of the values ​​of the enumeration type address_status_t: NO_ERROR - if the specified address belongs to the structure, or ADDRESS_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise.
address_status_t read_memory(memory_sector_t *, const int *address, int *buffer) - writing the content of the memory cell located at address to the variable located at buffer, if address belongs to the memory_sector_t structure. The function returns NO_ERROR if the data read succeeded, or ADDRESS_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise.
address_status_t write_memory(memory_sector_t *, int *address, int value) - writing the value value to the address address, if address belongs to the memory_sector_t structure. The function returns NO_ERROR if the data write succeeded, or ADDRESS_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise. In the main() function (in the file main.cpp), a set of tests for functions from the memory_operations.h header file is written using the assert macro. The goal of the task is to write the definitions of functions from the memory_operations.h header (and place them in the memory_operations.cpp source file) so that after compilation and execution of the program, the message "All tests passed!" is displayed. The memory_sector_t structure is schematically presented in Figure 3.1.
