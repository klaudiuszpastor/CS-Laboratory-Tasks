***The fib.h header file contains a declaration of the fibonacci(unsigned int) function, which calculates the nth expression of the Fibonacci sequence. A recursive implementation of the fibonacci(unsigned int) function has been placed in the source file fib.cpp. Trace the function's operation with the GDB debugger and find the error contained in the recursive implementation, and then implement the algorithm correctly in an iterative manner.***
