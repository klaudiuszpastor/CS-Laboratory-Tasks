***The header file multiply.h contains the declaration of the of the multiply(int, int) function, which performs multiplication of two integers. The definition of this function can be found in the multiply.cpp source file. Overload the multiply() function so that multiplication operations can be performed on floating-point numbers. Call both functions inside the main() function (file main.cpp). Using the nm program (GNU package ) check how the decorated function names multiply(int, int) and multiply(float, float). What happens when the function declaration multiply(int, int) is nested in the extern block "C"?***
