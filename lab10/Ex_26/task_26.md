Using the implementation of a singly linked list presented in section 2.3.1, write the function void removeByIndex(Node **root, unsigned int index) that removes the node at index index from the singly linked list. If the list does not have an element at the given index, the function does not modify the list. Test the implemented function, considering the following cases:

    empty list – removing the node at index 0;
    empty list – removing the node at an index greater than 0;
    single-element list – removing the node at index 0;
    single-element list – removing the node at an index greater than 0;
    n-element list – removing the node at index 0;
    n-element list – removing the node at index 1;
    n-element list – removing the node at index n + 1.
